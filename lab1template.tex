% This is the alpha version of lab report template in LaTeX.
% Originally used by Daniel Whisman (enrolled in ECE 486, Fall 2013)
% Edited and redesigned by Y\"un L. Han.
% 2014-09-07

% It is recommended to use 
%
% TeXLive on Linux, url: http://tug.org/texlive/
% MacTex on Mac OS X, url: http://tug.org/mactex/
% MikTeX on Windows, url: http://miktex.org/

% For more info about how to use LaTeX (not TeX, TeX is a programming
% language, however LaTeX is not), see a quick guide from ECE Thesis wiki,

% https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECEThesisReview/LaTeX+Resources

% Read the Documentation file ECE LaTeX Guide.pdf down at the bottom 
% of the page. As a starter, you only have to learn briefly how to typeset 
% equations and insert figures and other graphics. As an experienced user,
% however, you can grab the template and write your report immediately.

\subsection*{Discussion of Variation of $\zeta$ with $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$ \score 5}
% add your discussion here
% for example
(As $\zeta$ decreases, how does $M_p$ change? As $\zeta$ decreases, how about $t_r$ and $t_s$?)

\section*{Question 2 \score 15}

\subsection*{Effect of $\zeta$ on Pole Locations \score 5}
(Solve for poles in terms of $\zeta$ and sketch a plot of trajectory of pole locations [you can use {\sc Matlab\RR}] when $\zeta$ varies.)

\subsection*{Effect of Pole Locations on $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$ for an Underdamped System \score 5}
(What is the value of $\zeta$ when a system is \emph{underdamped}? As $\zeta$ increases, what happens to $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$?)
% add your discussion here

\subsection*{Effect of Pole Locations on $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$ for an Overdamped/Critically Damped System \score 5}
(What is the value of $\zeta$ when a system is \emph{overdamped}? \emph{Critically damped}? And as $\zeta$ increases, what happens to $M_p$, $t_r$, and $t_s$?)
% add your discussion here

\section*{Question 3 \score 10}

\subsection*{Comparison of $2^{\rm nd}$ Order System with $1^{\rm st}$ Order System with Dominant Pole \score 6}
(What are the similarities/differences between the response of an overdamped $2^{\rm nd}$ order system to the response of a $1^{\rm st}$ order system with the \emph{dominant} (less negative, closer to the origin) pole of the $2^{\rm nd}$ order's poles?)
% add your discussion here

\subsection*{Effect of $\zeta$ on Accuracy of Approximation \score 4}
(What is the effect of magnitude of $\zeta$ on the accuracy of the approximations? Also include your graphs.)
