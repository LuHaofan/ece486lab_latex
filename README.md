### New Lab Report Template in LaTeX 

> LaTeX template for ECE 486 Lab; this template should be used with "report" section in the lab manual. Please read the documentation for details in the preamble of each `*.tex` file. 

It is recommended to use 

> `TeXLive` on Linux, http://tug.org/texlive

> `MacTex` on Mac OS X, http://tug.org/mactex

> `MikTeX` on Windows, http://miktex.org

For more info about how to use LaTeX (not TeX, TeX is a programming language, however LaTeX is not), see a quick guide from ECE Thesis wiki,

> https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECEThesisReview/LaTeX+Resources

Read the Documentation file ECE LaTeX Guide.pdf down at the bottom of the page. As a starter, you only have to learn briefly how to typeset equations and insert figures. As an experienced user, however, you can grab the template and write your report immediately.
