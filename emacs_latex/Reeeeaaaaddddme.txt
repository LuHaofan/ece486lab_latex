Emacs + LaTeX for ECE 486
=========================

Why emacs?
----------

In a nutshell: emacs is arguably the most powerful editor on earth.

More details: The emacs key bindings are widely used in other applications.
For example, terminals on Linux/Mac support emacs-like navigation; Matlab also
ships a built-in emacs keyboard shortcut.


What is included?
-----------------

Inside N:\labs\ECE486\ece486_Emacs_LaTeX folder:

  - emacs_latex.7z                   (available on lab computers only)
  - signature.sha256                 (available on lab computers only)
  - public_key.pem                   (available on lab computers only)
  - openssl-1.0.2l-i386-win32.zip    (available on lab computers only)
  - Reeeaaaaddddme.txt (this file)   (available on lab computers/github repo)

  Note: Read '_emacs' file in github repo so you can have your own setup.

How to use this?
----------------

(1) Verify 'emacs_latex.7z' package

    The 'emacs_latex.7z' zip has been signed by YÃ¼n. You can use openssl to
    verify the package. Follow the steps below,

    (1.1) Start command line prompt and 'cd' to where 'openssl.exe' resides.
          We shipped with this file a zip file for openssl windows binaries.
    (1.2) Issue commands below, modify <pub_key>, <sig_sha256> etc. accordingly.
          (<pub_key> = public_key.pem and <sig_sha256> = signature.sha256)

	 # decode signature 
    	 >openssl.exe base64 -d -in <sig_sha256> -out <tmp_sign.sha256>
         # verify signature
	 >openssl.exe dgst -sha256 -verify <pub_key> -signature <tmp_sign.sha256>
          emacs_latex.7z

    (1.3) You should see 'Verified OK' if the package is intact.

    In case the included openssl zip has been tampered, it is available

    https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries

    In case the public key has been tampered, it is posted here

    https://chipnotized.org/ref.html#pub_key

(2) Unpack 'emacs_latex.7z'

    You might need 7-Zip from

    http://www.7-zip.org/7z.html.

    Once 'emacs_latex.7z' is unpacked, you will see four folders:

    - emacs25          (editor)
    - hunspell1323     (spell checker)
    - miktex29         (TeX suite)
    - SumatraPDF312    (PDF viewer)

(3) First use

    No installation is needed. This setup is completely portable and can be used
    on USB flash drives.

    (3.1) (Optional) Go to 'emacs25' folder and rename '_emacs' to '.emacs'.
    (3.2) 'emacs_launch.bat' alongside '_emacs' is the app launcher. Please
          read this file first. You may want to create a desktop shortcut by
	  right click --> 'send to desktop'.
    (3.3) Once emacs is up, drag and drop '_emacs' file into emacs window and
          read '_emacs' carefully. It is a detailed how to.


Known setup problems
--------------------

(1) Inverse search feature requires a correctly set value for
    'InverseSearchCmdLine' in 'SumatraPDF-settings.txt' (in 'SumatraPDF312'
    folder).

    InverseSearchCmdLine = "<WHERE>\emacs_latex\emacs25\bin\emacsclientw.exe" -n
    +%l "%f"

    Depending on where you unpacked 7z package, you might want to hard code the
    absolute path for 'emacsclientw.exe'.

    (Fixed. See 'emacs_launch.bat' file.)

(2) On Win 10, similar to problem (1), you might need to hard code where
    'SumatraPDF.exe' is in the '_emacs' file (line 313). Win 7 does not have 
    this problem.

    (Fixed. See '_emacs' file, line 316.)
