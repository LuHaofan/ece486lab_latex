How to use this?
----------------

(1) Verify 'emacs_latex.7z' package

    The 'emacs_latex.7z' file has been signed by YÃ¼n. To use openssl to verify
    the package, follow the steps below,

    (1.1) Start command line prompt and 'cd' to where 'openssl.exe' resides.
          We shipped with this file a zip file for openssl windows binaries.
    (1.2) Issue the command (modify <pub_key>, <sig_sha256> accordingly)

         >openssl.exe dgst -sha256 -verify <pub_key> -signature <sig_sha256>
          emacs_latex.7z

    (1.3) You should see 'Verified OK' if the package is intact.

    In case included openssl zip has been tampered, it is available

    https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries

(2) Unpack 'emacs_latex.7z'

    You might need 7-Zip from

    http://www.7-zip.org/7z.html.

    Once 'emacs_latex.7z' is unpacked, you will see four folders:

    - emacs25          (editor)
    - hunspell1323     (spell checker)
    - miktex29         (TeX suite)
    - SumatraPDF312    (PDF viewer)

(3) First use

    No installation is needed. This setup is portable.

    (3.1) Go to 'emacs25' folder and rename '_emacs' to '.emacs'. (optional)
    (3.2) 'emacs_launch.bat' alongside '_emacs' is the app launcher. You can
          create a desktop shortcut by right click --> 'send to desktop'.
    (3.3) Once emacs is up, drag and drop '_emacs' file into emacs window and
          read '_emacs' carefully. It is a detailed how to.

Known setup problems
--------------------

(1) Inverse search feature requires a correctly set value for
    'InverseSearchCmdLine' in 'SumatraPDF-settings.txt' (in 'SumatraPDF312'
    folder).

    InverseSearchCmdLine = "<WHERE>\emacs_latex\emacs25\bin\emacsclientw.exe" -n
    +%l "%f"

    Depending on where you unpacked 7z package, you might want to hard code the 
	absolute path for 'emacsclientw.exe'.

(2) On Win 10, similar to problem (1), you might hard code where
    'SumatraPDF.exe' is in the '_emacs' file (line 313).
